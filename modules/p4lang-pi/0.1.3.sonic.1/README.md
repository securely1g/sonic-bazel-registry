# PI source producer for SONiC

This entry builds the exact `p4lang-pi 0.1.3-2` source package selected by the
legacy SONiC Make rules. Its expanded submodules come from the checksum-verified
original source archive, mirrored unchanged in the registry's
`p4-source-inputs-20261021` release. The release includes the descriptor and SHA-256
provenance receipt. No upstream BCR entry exists for PI under its known names.

The source's configure/Make build retains `--with-proto --with-cli`, the Debian
P4Info compatibility edit, and SONiC's omission of `google/__init__.py`. Native
source builds use the shared SONiC GCC/sysroot and declared Autotools, Libtool,
Python, protoc and gRPC plugins. Target libraries come from the shared pinned
Trixie package resolver. These are execution/target inputs, not newly built DEBs.

## Public outputs

- `:sdk`: complete installed headers, libraries and `CcInfo`, including generated
  P4Runtime/gNMI headers for BMv2 and DASH.
- `:runtime`: stripped PI libraries and command-line tools, generated Python
  bindings under `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages`, and license notices.
- `:runtime.debug_symbols`: matching build-ID-addressed DWARF symbols.

The SDK retains development files; runtime TARs do not include static archives,
headers, libtool archives, bytecode or Debian packages. Legacy Make is unchanged.

## Validation

Native AMD64 and ARM64 registry CI build both TARs and the SDK, compile/run a C++
SDK consumer, check runtime ELF architecture/SONAME links and debug build IDs,
load the installed tools with declared target libraries, round-trip P4Info text through its binary protobuf form, and resolve a source line with GDB. The native runs must pass before merge.
This producer must land before consumers replace their temporary candidate pin.
