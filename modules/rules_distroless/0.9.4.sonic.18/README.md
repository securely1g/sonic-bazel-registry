# Distributed APT requests and workspace locks

Components keep their `apt.install` and `apt.install_file` declarations. A root
`apt.import_lock` selects the production graph for the shared extension;
dependency locks remain standalone defaults. Sources still use `sources_file`.

`apt.export_requests(name = "apt_request_export")` creates the public
`@apt_request_export//:requests` JSON export without fetching package indexes.
It contains evaluated requests, the selected source document, production lock
path and root `apt.lock_view` outputs. Collection-only repositories provide the
existing `use_repo` namespaces without fetching DEBs.

`apt.lock_view(file = "//image:apt.lock.json", dependency_sets = ["image_deps"])`
declares an updater-managed compatibility view, not a second production graph.
Production locks with `_inputs.distributed = true` require exact agreement with
the current evaluated request document, including removals.

Use the sonic-build-infra workspace updater to collect, resolve and publish.
Original DEB/data/control targets, library exports and versioned repositories
remain available. Existing package identities and checksums remain enforced.

Optional source-record `default_architectures` selects the nonempty subset of
`architectures` used for requests without architecture qualifiers. Explicit
qualifiers can still select other configured architectures. Omitting the field
preserves the previous all-configured-architectures behavior. Infrastructure
uses AMD64/ARM64 defaults while retaining explicit ARMHF cross inputs.
